Terraform Project
===============


This repository contains Terraform code for provisioning infrastructure resources across various platforms. Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that allows you to define and manage your infrastructure in a declarative configuration language.

**Prerequisites**
===============
Before running the Terraform code, ensure that you have the following installed:

Terraform (version 1.0 or later)
Cloud Provider CLI Tools (e.g., AWS CLI, Azure CLI, GCP SDK)
Access credentials for your cloud provider
Setting Up
Clone this repository to your local machine:

#bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/ali2307/Terraform.git
cd Terraform
Initialize the Terraform working directory:

#bash
Copy code
terraform init
Review the configuration and make necessary adjustments, such as defining variables or changing resource configurations.

Validate the configuration:

bash
Copy code
terraform validate
Apply the configuration to provision resources:

bash
Copy code
terraform apply
You may be prompted to confirm changes before proceeding. Type yes to apply.

**Directory Structure**
=======================
Exercise1/: Contains Terraform configuration for [describe resources in Exercise1].
Exercise2/: Contains Terraform configuration for [describe resources in Exercise2].
Exercise3/: Contains Terraform configuration for [describe resources in Exercise3].
Exercise4/: Contains Terraform configuration for [describe resources in Exercise4].
Exercise5/: Contains Terraform configuration for [describe resources in Exercise5].
Exercise6/: Contains Terraform configuration for [describe resources in Exercise6].
Each directory contains the relevant Terraform configuration files (e.g., main.tf, variables.tf, outputs.tf) that define the infrastructure for each exercise.

**Resources Created**
====================
This Terraform code creates the following resources (you can modify the list based on what your Terraform files do):

**Virtual machines**
=====================
Networking resources (VPC, subnets, etc.)
Databases (e.g., RDS for AWS)
Storage (e.g., S3 buckets)
Other cloud resources depending on your configuration
Cleaning Up
To destroy all resources created by Terraform, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
terraform destroy
This will remove all the infrastructure resources that were provisioned.

**Notes**
=======
Ensure that your cloud provider credentials (API keys, etc.) are correctly configured.
If you're using a cloud provider like AWS, ensure that the proper IAM permissions are in place to create and manage resources.
